This project aims at create a fully open source Rubik's cube solving robot controller with the ability to use any robotics platform in a setup

Since this project is brand new, it will only support Lego NTX Mindstorms kit.

Since this is an educational project, it is released under the GPL in hopes that it will be free and useful to anyone

**Project temporarily on hold until further notice**
